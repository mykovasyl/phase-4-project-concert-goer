# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

Concert Go-er allows users to schedule their own and reserve tickets for concerts. Users who reserve tickets for a concert will have their username displayed on the concert modal as attending. This simple app is built to show the relationship between 3 models with 2 has_many through associations.

**Note on routing**: react-router-dom v6 was used. When changing front-end Routes, please double check your syntax. For more information, [check out this blog](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-router/)

## Cloning To Run Locally

The application is currently deployed with render. If you would like to run the application in localhost, do the following:

Start by **cloning** the application repository and removing the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:mykovasyl/phase-4-project-concert-goer.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc. â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those
files on GitHub will cause issues.

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

## Localhost Set-up

Include the following changes to your cloned repo to run localhost servers:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

Make sure to commit these changes to your cloned repo and run `bundle install` before launching the servers.

You can use the following commands to run the application servers:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Shut down servers with control+C.

## Seeding

The seed file includes a template for seeding data. To make seeding easier, the faker gem was included in the Gemfile. Get more info on [faker gem here](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
